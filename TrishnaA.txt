Hey there, my name is Trish!
Three words to describe me would be:
- Hard-working
- Friendly
- Quiet

I love learning to code(!) dancing, singing, cooking, binge-watching my favorite shows and spending time with family.
The 2 things I'm laser focused and motivated in is becoming a web developer and officially getting into the field, and maintaining a sustainable
fitness lifestyle. My favorite non-thinking hobby is probably dancing, and my favorite animal is a dog.
